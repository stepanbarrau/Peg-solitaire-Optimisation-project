# Peg-solitaire-Optimisation-project
This is  project Michelle Evans-Bouchet and I worked on for a class of discrete optimization. 
The goal is to solve the peg-solitaire game, using optimization methods.

Coded originally in a python notebook, requires cvxopt.

I will only upload an html version of the notebook, as well as the original .ipynb.
I will provide cleaned up .py code soon.
